# Prism Series

This project began as a daily form of image gathering during an artist residency in the Hudson Valley of New York. I made photographs through a glass prism as a means of exploring a landscape with the grid of triangular form. Each day of the series, I went out and found new textures to focus on and selected one image that represented the most interesting of that dayâ€™s findings. The Prism Series helped facilitate the discovery of unfamiliar terrain and the process was documented with a recurring formal motif.
